# About Infobahn CTF Team

Infobahn is an international Capture the Flag (CTF) team made up of players from all around the world.  
We regularly participate in CTF competitions covering a wide range of categories, including:

- **Binary Exploitation** 
- **Reverse Engineering**  
- **Cryptography**
- **Web Hacking**  
- **Forensics**  
- **Miscellaneous challenges**  

Our team is built on collaboration, knowledge sharing, and the thrill of solving hard problems together.  
Whether itâ€™s late-night debugging sessions, cracking crypto puzzles, or reversing strange binaries, we thrive on the learning process and the camaraderie that comes with it.

## Our Philosophy

We believe CTFs are not only competitions but also opportunities to grow, share knowledge, and strengthen the global security community. By playing regularly, we aim to push our technical boundaries while having fun.
